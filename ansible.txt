1. Declare configurations and orchestrate manual ordered processes
2. Playbooks are written in YAML only
3. The flag sintax checking a playbook: --syntax-check
eg: ansible-playbook --syntax-check sample.yml

eg for an ansible playbook for linux, rhel7/centos 7
-hosts: cloud-nodes
-tasks:
 - name: ensure apache latest version
	yum:
	  name: httpd
	  state: latest
If not error appears, it's ok. Maybe could appear [Warning]

e.g.2:ansible-playbook --syntax-check -e"passed_in_hosts=localhost" jenkins-master.yml

you can check too with: echo $? If it returns 0, everything is ok.

## Building Jinja2 template for Jenkins Config via ansible

- Jinja is a designer-friendly, modern templating language for python
- Ansible uses Jinja2 templating for dynamic expressions and access to variables
- All templating happens on the Ansible controoler before the task is sent out to targets and executed.
This is done to reduce the requirements on the target nodes. Jinja2 is only required on the Ansible control node.

#Debugging

ANSIBLE_DEBUG environment variable enables very verbose logging and may even hinder multiprocessing
Not recommendned for Prod env

ANSIBLE_DEBUG can also display sensitive information and is not recom for prod

ANSIBLE_VERBOSITY environment variable or the -v flag with ansbile and ansible_playbook commands on CLI can also output debug logs to stdout
Incrementy the numbers of V on the flags, it will conver to be more verbosity
e.g. -vv is more verbose than -v
