## Terraform Backends
- Determines how to state is stored->local or remote
- By default, state is stored on local disk
- Variables cannot be used as input to Terraform block

Example:

terraform {
	required_version = ">=0.12.0"
	backend "s3" {
		region = "sa-east-1"
		profile = "default"
		}
	}

## Terraform Providers
- The source code for all terraform resources:
Providers carry out interactions with vendor APIs such as AWS and Azure
They also provide logic for managing, updating and creating resources in Terraform

- MultiProviders -> use Alias
